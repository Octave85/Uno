Uno Project Stuff to do/improve List

2/7/2012
-- Alias addresses of all the main program components (from ums) in Uno_parsemain and
VM_exec so that accesses are faster -- it's slower to go ums->stack->values than just
stack->values. Maybe even alias the values address itself.
-- Obstacks for memory management
-- Cache first 2-4 values on the stack in regular variables.
-- Maybe implement stack functions as macros?
-- Change STACK_START to a larger value -- we're not too concerned with memory,
only using about 5-6kB to start with anyway.
